      abstract: "This document is one in a series of use case documents that the Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium is developing to help better define the needs of different calendaring and scheduling user groups. As such, this document provides a list of use cases for a calendar access protocol only. Other use case documents will cover different areas of calendaring and scheduling, and will be made available by the Consortium in the usual manner. While this list of use cases was developed to assist in the development of the CalDAV protocol, none of the use cases are specific to CalDAV, that is, this list of use cases should apply to any calendar access protocol. It is expected that this document will be used as a basis to further develop technical requirements for a calendar access protocol such as CalDAV."

      abstract: "This document was created by the USECASE Technical Committee of the Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium. The document presents a recommendation for enhancing inter-operability of resources within the calendaring and scheduling application domain. Minimum interoperability is the basic level of functionality our collective experience tells us is necessary to have a useful system. The thrust of this effort is to enable resource inter-operability such that, when a described event contains resources, the recipient of that event is able to make practical use of the described resources; ideally the recipient should be so enabled regardless of whether the recipient is within the same calendaring domain. The resulting recommendations rely in part upon adoption of standards revisions that are in draft as of this writing."

      abstract: "This document, developed by the XML Technical Committee, specifies a SOAP web services Protocol for calendaring operations. This protocol has been contributed to OASIS WS-CALENDAR as a component of the WS-CALENDAR Specification under development by OASIS.

CalConnect and OASIS have agreed that any future work by CalConnect TC XML or OASIS WS-Calendar (or other committees in CalConnect and OASIS) on their respective versions of CalWS will be harmonized to maintain consistency between the versions. CalConnect and OASIS reserve the right to jointly and formally agree to fork the specifications at some point in the future if need arises.
