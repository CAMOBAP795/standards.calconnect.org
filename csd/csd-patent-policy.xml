non-profit organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of
collaborative technologies and tools through open standards.</p>
<p id="_20471511-aab4-4dfc-bf54-658cabc6f750">CalConnect works closely with international and regional partners,
of which the full list is available on our website
(<link target="https://www.calconnect.org/about/liaisons-and-relationships"/>).</p>
<p id="_fba43eed-9931-4d8b-865f-8054875bbbf2">The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its
further maintenance are described in the CalConnect Directives.</p>
<p id="_ea270847-dd65-4299-9db4-5ab0acc70acd">In particular the different approval criteria needed for the different
types of CalConnect documents should be noted. This document was drafted in
accordance with the editorial rules of the CalConnect Directives.</p>
<p id="_bfd3dec2-3212-4914-a36d-a3dcd8cc442a">Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this
document may be the subject of patent rights. CalConnect shall not be
held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. Details
of any patent rights identified during the development of the document
will be provided in the Introduction.</p>

<p id="_61143b8e-b30c-46c1-a8d9-d2157dda0176">This document was prepared by Technical Committee
<em>PUBLISH</em>.</p></foreword><introduction id="_introduction" obligation="informative"><title>Introduction</title><clause id="_general" obligation="informative"><title>General</title><p id="_1d3bf67a-6bb4-40b8-901e-553650442533">CalConnect is committed in expanding the realm of standards
in collaborative technologies with a focus on interoperability
across the globe and communities of practice.</p>
<p id="_de607471-e867-4a79-93d5-97727ba4710b">As a proponent of open standards, CalConnect does not endorse
mandatory usage of patents within CalConnect Standards.
The CalConnect Board of Directors has decided to align
IPR practice with major international standardization bodies
including ISO, IEC and ITU.</p></clause>
<clause id="_purpose" obligation="informative"><title>Purpose</title><p id="_b7f9c69b-5075-4051-b1be-c4d1bac43b26">This document describes the policy of CalConnect with regards to patent
usage within CalConnect deliverables and provides a
"code of practice" that is simple and straightforward.</p>
<p id="_7b84af47-e683-4d3b-aedd-83ae0ee5c983">CalConnect deliverables are drawn up by technical, not patent, experts,
who may not be fully aware of all nuisances in the complex
international legal situation of intellectual property rights.</p>
<p id="_495e7678-a47d-4761-9970-a62c2fac3b35">CalConnect deliverables are non-binding — their objective is to ensure
compatibility of technologies and systems on a worldwide basis.</p>
<p id="_72a9c2e7-ed36-4356-b421-3fed204b82f7">To meet this objective, which is in the common interests of all those
participating, it must be ensured that the usage and continued
application of CalConnect deliverables are accessible to everybody.</p>
<p id="_a1278e2f-f348-4cd6-b195-9a11ddcd26c8">Therefore, a patent embodied fully or partly in a CalConnect
deliverable must be accessible to everybody without undue constraints.</p></clause></introduction></preface><sections>

<clause id="_scope" obligation="normative"><title>Scope</title><p id="_8d318900-02f5-4f02-8c1b-4222b472d49f">This document provides the CalConnect patent policy, which governs all
standardization deliverables developed through the CalConnect
standardization process.</p>
<p id="_0a7065c6-e081-4cb9-b103-fdc2e6483fd1">The CalConnect patent policy is identical to the <eref type="inline" bibitemid="ISOPP" citeas="ISO/IEC/ITU common patent policy"/> in content,
except where:</p>
<ul id="_adedcbf4-2bbe-4b89-afbc-f6aefc27f1af">
  <li>

changed to "CalConnect";</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p id="_c2ce3aab-4af5-4d26-bc18-6c1974f22dce">deliverables and processes pertaining to those entities have been

  </li>
</ul>
<p id="_3b4ccdef-331e-4323-abde-22c159ab583c">Detailed arrangements arising from patents (licensing, royalties, etc.)

from case to case.</p></clause>

application, either their own or of other organizations, although
CalConnect is unable to verify the validity of any such information.</p>
<p id="_b4d2b35a-93a9-4385-b6ad-848dab90975e">In a joint deliverable developed with other standardization bodies,
